## 🔥 100 Days of DSA with JavaScript Challenge
# 🚀 DSA with JavaScript – Day 1 (Number Problems)

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript.

Today I solved fundamental number-based problems to strengthen my logic building and problem-solving skills.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to N
- Basic `for` loop implementation
- DOM manipulation example included
- Time Complexity: O(n)

---

### 2️⃣ Print Numbers from N to 1
- Reverse printing without modifying loop structure
- Mathematical subtraction logic

---

### 3️⃣ Print Even Numbers from 1 to N
- Used modulo operator `%`
- Filtering condition logic

---

### 4️⃣ Sum of First N Natural Numbers
Two approaches:

✅ Optimized Mathematical Formula:

- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Best Approach

❌ Brute Force Loop:
- Time Complexity: O(n)

---

### 5️⃣ Factorial of N
- Iterative multiplication approach
- Time Complexity: O(n)

---

### 6️⃣ Numbers Divisible by 3 and 5
- Used logical AND condition (`&&`)
- Multiples logic understanding

---

### 7️⃣ Sum of All Odd Numbers up to N
- Filtering odd numbers
- Accumulator pattern

---

### 8️⃣ Cube of Numbers from 1 to N
- Used exponent operator `**`
- Mathematical transformation

---

### 9️⃣ Even Perfect Squares up to N
- Used `Math.sqrt()` and `Math.floor()`
- Checked:
    - Perfect square condition
    - Even number condition
- Time Complexity: O(n)

Optimized version possible using:
